# Task 08 — Batch Size & Gradient Noise Experiment

## Objective
Study how batch size affects training behavior.

## Results
Small batch sizes produce noisy loss curves.
Large batch sizes produce smoother curves.

## Analysis
Smaller batches add gradient noise.
Larger batches reduce noise but may hurt generalization.

## Key Takeaway
Batch size affects both training stability and generalization.
