# Task 06 — L2 Regularization Experiment

## Objective
Study how L2 regularization affects model performance.

## Results
Small L2 values improve validation accuracy.
Large L2 values reduce both training and validation accuracy.

## Analysis
L2 regularization penalizes large weights.
This helps reduce overfitting and improves generalization.

## Key Takeaway
L2 regularization helps control model complexity.
