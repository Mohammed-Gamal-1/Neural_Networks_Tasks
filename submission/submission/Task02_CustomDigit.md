# Task 02 — Custom Image Generalization

## Objective
Test how well the model can predict a digit drawn by the user.

## Results
The model predicted the custom image with reasonable confidence.
In some cases, the prediction was incorrect.

## Analysis
The custom image is different from MNIST training images.
Differences in shape, noise, or thickness can affect prediction.
This shows the effect of data distribution on model performance.

## Key Takeaway
Neural networks work best when test data is similar to training data.
