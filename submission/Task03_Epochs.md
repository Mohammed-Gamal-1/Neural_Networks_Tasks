# Task 03 — Epoch-Based Learning Curve Exploration

## Objective
Study how changing the number of training epochs affects model performance.

## Results
With more epochs, training accuracy increases.
Validation accuracy improves at first but later increases slowly.

## Analysis
Few epochs cause underfitting.
More epochs help the model learn better.
Too many epochs can lead to overfitting.
Adam optimizer helps speed up learning.

## Key Takeaway
Choosing the right number of epochs is important for good generalization.
