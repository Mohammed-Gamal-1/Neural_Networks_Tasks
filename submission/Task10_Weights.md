# Task 10 — Weight Inspection & Model Capacity Analysis

## Objective
Inspect model weights and understand model capacity.

## Results
The Dense layer has many parameters.

## Analysis
Large models have high capacity.
High capacity can lead to overfitting.
Regularization methods help reduce this risk.

## Key Takeaway
Model capacity must be controlled for good generalization.
