# Task 05 — Dropout Ablation Study

## Objective
Study the effect of Dropout on model performance.

## Results
Without Dropout, the model overfits.
Dropout 0.1 improves validation performance.
Dropout 0.3 slows training and reduces accuracy.

## Analysis
Dropout randomly disables neurons during training.
This prevents overfitting and improves generalization.

## Key Takeaway
Dropout helps control overfitting but too much Dropout can hurt performance.
