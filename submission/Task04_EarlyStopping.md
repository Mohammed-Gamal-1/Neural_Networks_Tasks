# Task 04 — EarlyStopping Behavior Analysis

## Objective
Understand how EarlyStopping affects training behavior.

## Results
Training stopped before reaching the maximum number of epochs.
Validation loss stopped improving.

## Analysis
EarlyStopping monitors validation loss.
When validation loss increases, training is stopped.
This helps prevent overfitting and improves generalization.

## Key Takeaway
EarlyStopping is a simple and effective regularization method.
